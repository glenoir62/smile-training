# Gogo Shell Command

The Gogo Shell Command sample demonstrates adding a custom command to Liferay
Portal's Gogo shell environment. All Liferay Portal installations have a Gogo
shell environment, which lets system administrators interact with Liferay
Portal's module framework on a local server machine.
